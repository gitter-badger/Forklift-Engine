This is the Forklift Java + LWJGL2 Game engine. The Engine is built to be a 'player' for data files. This repository contains the Engine playes, and a runnable demonstration. All the demonstration files are in the ```data``` directory and can be changed to make your own creation! An Editor for the Engine is also in the plans. The demonstration will be removed from this repository, once the Editor is complete.

## License

The Engine is licenced under the MIT licence, as seen [here](License.md). We do however ask you to not sell the Engine, as it is meant to be a free tool.

## Support

* Bug Reports can be filled directly in the Issue tracker of this Repository.
* We have a chatroom at Gitter for any other support you might need.
